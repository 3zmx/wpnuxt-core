WPNuxt Core is a plugin for Nuxt 3 that provides a set of composables, hooks, and utilities for working with WordPress.

It will render the content as is it returned by the WordPress GraphQL API.

## Gutenberg Blocks

By default the GraphQL API returns the content of the page as an HTML string. When using WPNuxt Core this content is rendered as is, with the help of the [vue-sanitize-directive](https://github.com/leopiccionia/vue-sanitize-directive){target=_blank} to make sure we get clean HTML.

Hovever, if you want to use and customise separate vue components to render Gutenberg blocks, you can use the [WPNuxt Blocks](/blocks) plugin.
