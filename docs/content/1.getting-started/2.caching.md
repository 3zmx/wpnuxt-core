## nuxt-multi-cache

WPNuxt can use nuxt-multi-cache to cache the data that's being fetched from wordpress.

nuxt-multi-cache is enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting enableMultiCache to true:
```
    wpNuxt: {
        ...
        enableMultiCache: false
    },
```

These are the settings that WPNuxt is using by default:
```
  multiCache: {
    debug: false,
    component: {
      enabled: false,
    },
    route: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  },
```

You can override this in nuxt.config.ts of your app. For example if you'd want to enable debug mode, use component caching or turn off the route caching:
```
  multiCache: {
    debug: true,
    component: {
      enabled: true,
    },
    route: {
      enabled: false,
    },
  },
```
At the moment this can only be overridden by adding the multicache module as a dependency in your app too.
