## Try it online

[open demo in StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/vernaillen/wpnuxt-demo)

## New Project

### Configure Wordpress

install these 2 plugins in WordPress:
 * [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
 * [WPEngine's Gutenberg Blocks](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks)

enable introspection in the WPGraphQL settins

Set the WordPress permalinks to postname (so the slug can be used as a dynamic route in Nuxt)


### Add WPNuxt to your Nuxt app

```
pnpm add -D @vernaillen/wpnuxt
```

nuxt-config.ts
```
modules: ['@vernaillen/wpnuxt']
```

### Configure Image Provider

Since images are uploaded in WordPress, we can configure Nuxt Image to use an image provider that fetches the images from WordPress and optimises them.
